RnD Day: Microservices Hands-On

# Goals

- experience core principles of Microservices architecture
  - isolated runtimes
  - Java & Spring Boot technology stack
  - persistence with JPA
  - exposes synchronous REST/JSON endpoints
  - consumes external synchronous REST/JSON endpoints
  - sends asynchronous events over message bus
  - receives asynchronous events over message bus

# Use Case

This project contains a collection of four microservices
based on spring-boot, communicating via REST and AMQP.
The "start-group-delivery" and "start-group-bakery"
branches contain the starting points for implementing
two services. The "ref" branch contains the reference
implementations. Avoid peeking here without trying yourself
first. :-)
